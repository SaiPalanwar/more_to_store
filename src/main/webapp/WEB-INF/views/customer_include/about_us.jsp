<h1 class="text-center" style="font-size:40px; ">About Us</h1>
<h3 class="text-primary text-center">Almost every activity in the world today is controlled by computer driven software programs. However, as the life style became more and more complex, every area of human interactions is occupied by various software systems. This project focuses attention on designing efficient and reliable software which can be used by vendor/retailer to put up their products and customers for buying desired product. Maintaining a store / super market with all possible types of products can be difficult and will need more man power to work at store. Making the store online will save more time and man power. A customer has to invest his/her valuable time when he needs to buy a product. In briefly, the manual process is very slow. But automation will reduce the time taken in the whole process. In an online store we could deal with a large number to products with ease. Previously shopkeeper had to maintain records in document form. Therefore, there may be defective reports. But in case of online storage this work becomes very easy and free from complexity. So for the betterment of client and shopkeeper online store is more efficient. The purpose of this project is to provide easy shopping facility online and easy selling facility to the merchants of all categories. Other small / big retailer / shop owner / vendor can register onto the website and add his/her products online and get the business going.

      <h2>Problem Statement
</h2>
      <hr>
		<p>To buy a variety of products you have to visit a variety of shops and that again is not very productive; there does not exist any true one stop shop, everything under a single roof
			</p>
			<p>In lock-down the accessibility to offline shops became limited; the risks of exposure to COVID-19 also increases when more people go out of their house, one of the reasons being shopping

      <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
      <hr>
		<p>An online shopping system can make purchase of products more convenient and easy. The vendors can open their store online regardless of whether they have a physical store for themselves. The online store are maintenance free and the vendor doesnâ€™t have to pay rent and electricity bills for running the online store. They can easily migrate or extend their existing store online. People with products to sell can also become the vendors, thus maximising the variety of the available products.
